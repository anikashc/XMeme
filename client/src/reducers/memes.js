/*  Reducers are a pure function in Redux. Pure functions are predictable. 
*   Reducers are the only way to change states in Redux. It is the only place where you 
*   can write logic and calculations. Reducer function will accept the previous state of 
*   app and action being dispatched, calculate the next state and returns the new object.
*
*   The following few things should never be performed inside the reducer âˆ’
*
*   - Mutation of functions arguments
*   - API calls & routing logic
*   - Calling non-pure function e.g. Math.random()
